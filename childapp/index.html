1) seems alert, content, and active<br><br>
2) is steadily gaining weight, growing, and developing<br><br>
3) feeds six to eight times per day<br><br>
4) is wetting and soiling diapers on a regular basis<br><br>

            <div class="collapsible-body"><div>Most babies this age are introduced to solid foods. Experts recommend gradually introducing solid foods when a baby is about 6 months old, depending on the baby's readiness and nutritional needs.
Be sure to check with your doctor before starting any solid foods.<br>
<h6><strong class="blue-text">Is My Baby Ready to Eat Solids?</strong></h6>
How can you tell if your baby is ready for solids? Here are a few hints:<br><br>
1) Is your baby's tongue-thrust reflex gone or diminished? This reflex, which prevents infants from choking, also causes them to push food out of their mouths.<br><br>
2) Can your baby support his or her own head? To eat solid food, an infant needs good head and neck control and should be able to sit up.
<br><br>
3) Is your baby interested in food? A 6-month-old baby who stares and grabs at your food at dinnertime is clearly ready for some variety in the food department.

            <div class="collapsible-body"><div>By about 8 months old, most babies are pros at handling the iron-fortified infant cereals and the pureed foods that have been introduced as part of their diet along with breast milk or formula.
Over the next few months, they start to explore table foods.<br>
<h6><strong class="blue-text">Changing Eating Habits</strong></h6>As you expand your baby's palate, continue to give new foods a trial run (a few days to a week) to look for any allergic reactions. But:
<br><br>
1) Do not give honey until after a baby's first birthday. Honey may contain certain spores that, while harmless to adults, can causebotulism in babies.<br><br>
2) And do not give regular cow's milk until your baby is older than 12 months because it does not have the nutrition that infants need.
<br><br>
By the first birthday, babies usually are ready to go from formula to cow's milk. If you're breastfeeding, you can continue beyond your baby’s first birthday, if desired, or you may decide to stop.

<div>Toddlers this age are moving from the eating habits they had as infants toward a diet more like your own.<br><br> Your job is to keep introducing new flavors and textures. Food preferences are set early in life, so help your child develop a taste for healthy foods now.
<br><br>Toddlers have little tummies, so serve foods that are packed with the nutrients they need to grow healthy and strong, and limit the sweets and empty calories.
<br><br>Toddlers also like to assert their independence, and the table is one place where you should give yours some sense of control. Allow your toddler to respond to internal cues for hunger and fullness but set the boundaries.</div>

 <h6><strong class="blue-text">A Word About Milk</strong></h6>
 <p>Milk is an important part of a toddler's diet because it provides calcium and vitamin D, which help build strong bones. Most kids under age 2 should drink whole milk for the dietary fats needed for normal growth and brain development.</p><p>When your child is 2, you can make the switch to low-fat or nonfat milk.</p>

         <h6><strong class="blue-text">First Trimester Prenatal Screening Tests</strong></h6>
         <p class="no-padding">This screening process can help to determine the risk of the fetus having certain birth defects. Screening tests may be used alone or in combination with other tests.There are three parts of first trimester screening:</p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>1) Ultrasound test for fetal nuchal translucency (NT)</strong>. Nuchal translucency screening uses an ultrasound test to examine the area at the back of the fetal neck for increased fluid or thickening and to determine  pregnancy date.</p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>2) Two maternal serum (blood) tests.</strong>The blood tests measure two substances found in the blood of all pregnant women:</p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>3) Pregnancy-associated plasma protein screening (PAPP-A)--</strong> a protein produced by the placenta in early pregnancy. Abnormal levels are associated with an increased risk for chromosome abnormality.</p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>3) Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)--</strong> a hormone produced by the placenta in early pregnancy. Abnormal levels are associated with an increased risk for chromosome abnormality.</p>
         <h6><strong class="blue-text">Second Trimester Prenatal Screening Tests</strong></h6>
         <p class="no-padding">This Screening is usually performed by taking a sample of the mother's blood between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy (16th to 18th is ideal). The multiple markers include:</p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>Alpha-fetoprotein screening (AFP).</strong>This blood test measures the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the mothers' blood during pregnancy. AFP is a protein normally produced by the fetal liver and is present in the fluid surrounding the fetus (amniotic fluid), and crosses the placenta into the mother's blood. The AFP blood test is also called MSAFP (maternal serum AFP).Abnormal levels of AFP may signal the following:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>-Open neural tube defects (ONTD), such as spina bifida</li>
          <li>-Down syndrome</li>
          <li>-Other chromosomal abnormalities</li>
          <li>-Defects in the abdominal wall of the fetus</li>
          <li>-Twins--more than one fetus is making the protein</li>

         <h6><strong>Foods You Should Eat</strong></h6>
         <p class="no-padding">During pregnancy, the goal is to be eating nutritious foods most of the time. To maximize prenatal nutrition, doctors advises emphasizing the following five food groups: fruits, vegetables, lean protein, whole grains and dairy products. </p>
         <div class="col s12"><img class="responsive-img" src="images/f1.jpg"></div><div class="col s12"><img class="responsive-img" src="images/f2.jpg"></div>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>Fruits and vegetables:  Lean protein:  Whole grains  Dairy</strong></p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>Folic acid</strong>, also known as folate when found in foods, is a B vitamin that is crucial in helping to prevent birth defects in the baby's brain and spine.Food sources: leafy green vegetables, fortified or enriched cereals, breads and pastas.</p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>Calcium</strong>is a mineral used to build a baby's bones and teeth. If a pregnant woman does not consume enough calcium, the mineral will be drawn from the mother's stores in her bones and given to the baby to meet the extra demands of pregnancy.Food sources: milk, yogurt, cheese, calcium-fortified juices and foods, sardines or salmon with bones, some leafy greens (kale, bok choy).</p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>Iron:</strong>Pregnant women need 27 milligrams of iron a day, which is double the amount needed by women who are not expecting.Food sources: meat, poultry, fish, dried beans and peas, iron-fortified cereal.</p>
        <p class="no-padding"><strong>Protein:</strong>More protein is needed during pregnancy, but most women don't have problems getting enough of these foods in their diets.Food sources: meat, poultry, fish, dried beans and peas, eggs, nuts, tofu.</p>
         <h6><strong>Foods You Should AVOID</strong></h6>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>Caffeine</strong> Taking in high doses of caffeine daily during pregnancy -- whether from coffee, tea, cola, cocoa, or energy drinks -- has long been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage</p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>Soft cheeses</strong> It's best to avoid cheeses such as Brie, goat, Camembert, feta, queso blanco, and blue or other veined varieties. Why? They may be unpasteurized and contaminated with listeria -- bacteria that can trigger food poisoning. 
         </p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>Fish</strong> You probably already know that mercury, which is present in many fish, is dangerous for your baby. 
         </p>
        <p class="no-padding"><strong>Eggs</strong> No one is going to tell you to avoid eggs, which are a high-quality source of protein and contain important nutrients like choline. But eggs do have some risk of being contaminated with salmonella, which is more dangerous for pregnant women than for the general population.
         </p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>ALCHOHOL:</strong> Absolutely not, warn many experts. Heavy drinking can lead to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which causes mental retardation and a host of abnormalities. 
         </p>

         <h4 class="red-text">Physical and Emotional Changes :</h4>
         <div class="col s12"><img class="responsive-img" src="images/chnages.png"></div>
         <h6><strong>The Physical Changes During Pregnancy</strong></h6>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>Nasuea </strong>"Morning sickness," as it is typically referred to, is present usually from 6 to 14 weeks, but may last the majority of the pregnancy. Some women do not experience morning sickness while others are hospitalized for periodic worsening that prevents proper hydration and/or nutrition. </p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>Sore and growing breasts </strong>,Early in your pregnancy, your breasts may be tender and swollen. After the first few months, your areolas — the pigmented circles around your nipples — will also be bigger and darker. Later in the pregnancy as your breasts prepare for breastfeeding, they get even bigger and may leak an early form of milk called colostrum. Be sure to wear a well-fitting bra that provides both comfort and support.</p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>Fatigue and body aches</strong>Fatigue is very common in the first four months of pregnancy. This is mostly due to the hormone effects of early pregnancy, but increased fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance is common throughout pregnancy.</p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>Growing abdomen</strong>The most apparent physical change will be your growing mid-section. For most women, this growth is noticed from the fourth month through the end of pregnancy.</p>
          <p class="no-padding"><strong>Stretch marks and skin changes</strong>Stretch marks—they’re one of the most talked about changes during pregnancy, and also one of the most common. They appear in 50 to 90 percent of all pregnant women, usually showing up in the latter half of pregnancy.</p>
          <p class="no-padding"><strong>Weight gain</strong>Normal weight gain ranges from 25 to 35 pounds. Most weight gain happens between 10 to 40 weeks with approximately 8 pounds per 10 weeks. During the first 10 weeks, some may have a small drop in weight or if nausea and/or vomiting issues are steady, but most women gain 3 pounds or less in the first 10 weeks.During pregnancy, you should only consume 300 more calories per day than the normal dietary needs.</p>
          <p class="no-padding"><strong>Digestive and urinary issues</strong>The digestive system slows down the movement of fluids and solids through the body during pregnancy and increased uterine size increases pressure on intestinal tract. Both processes increase the risk for nausea, vomiting, constipation and haemorrhoids</p>
          <p class="no-padding">Urination may become increasingly frequent due to enlargement of the uterus and pressure placed on the bladder. During pregnancy there is an increased risk for urinary tract infections, but common symptoms of UTI, such as painful urination, may be reduced due to hormonal changes in urinary tract.</p>
         <h6><strong>The Emotional Changes During Pregnancy</strong></h6>
         <p class="no-padding">During pregnancy it is normal to be preoccupied with how your body is quickly changing, how to manage symptoms, how different your life is becoming, worry about the pregnancy going well, finances, and keeping up with everyday life.It is common to go through many of the following changes in a pregnancy:</p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>-First trimester.</strong>Extreme fatigue or morning sickness can color your daily life. Moodiness (as with premenstrual syndrome) is normal. Happiness and anxiety about a new pregnancy, or feeling upset about an unplanned pregnancy, are also common.</p>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>-Second trimester.</strong>Fatigue, morning sickness, and moodiness usually improve or go away. You may feel more forgetful and disorganized than before. Looking heavier than normal, then looking visibly pregnant and feeling the baby move, can make you feel any number of emotions.
         </p>
        <p class="no-padding"><strong>-Third trimester.</strong>Forgetfulness may continue. As your due date nears, it is common to feel more anxious about the childbirth and how a new baby will change your life. As you feel more tired and uncomfortable, you may be more irritable than before.
         </p>
         <p class="no-padding">For some women, serious anxiety or depression problems improve during pregnancy. For others, they do not. If you find no pleasure in daily life, or suffer from a lot of sleeplessness (insomnia), sadness, tearfulness, anxiety, hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, irritability, appetite change, or poor concentration, talk to your health professional. Without treatment, mental health problems can get in the way of a healthy pregnancy.

          <li>-Hot or Bikram yoga</li>
          <li>-Major backbends</li>
          <li>-Lower spinal or deep twists</li>

          <li>-Belly down postures (Cobra, Locust, Bow, etc.)</li>
          <li>-Lying on your back for a long time</li>
          <li>-Overstretch – Your body, clever little thing it is, is producing a hormone that softens tissues and ligaments in the pelvic floor (trust me you’ll be grateful for this when b-day rolls around!), which increases your risk of pulling a muscle if you stretch further than usual.</li>
          <li>-Breath retention (kumbhaka)</li>
         </ul>
         <h6><strong>What to Do While Pregnant</strong></h6>
         <ul>
          <li>-Get the all-clear from your doc or midwife</li>
          <li>-Be present in your body and with your baby</li>
          <li>-Be gentle and kind to yourself</li>
          <li>-Listen to, and love, your body</li>
          <li>-Check all judgment at the door</li>
         </ul>
         <h6><strong>What to Do While Pregnant</strong></h6>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>1. Reclined Bound Angle Pose (Supta Baddha Konasana)</strong>This pose increases blood circulation in the lower abdomen, stretches the groin, and increases external rotation in the hips. It’s also my favourite way to calm down and relax my anxious mind.Make sure to modify this posture for pregnancy by placing a bolster or two under your back and head to create an incline (so you are not flat on your back), and a block between feet to broaden your pelvis.</p>
         <div class="col s12"><img class="responsive-img" src="images/exercise/1.jpg"></div>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>2. Child’s Pose (Balasana) </strong>Balasana can fight off nausea, relieve anxiety, and quiet the mind. Modify for pregnancy by placing a bolster under the torso for support.</p>
         <div class="col s12"><img class="responsive-img" src="images/exercise/2.jpg"></div>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>3. Cat/Cow Pose (Marjaryasana Bitilasana)</strong>As the baby grows, more pressure is put on the spine, so moving on hands and knees relieves that pressure. Table Top position also encourages the baby into proper position for delivery and can provide relief during contractions in labour.</p>
         <div class="col s12"><img class="responsive-img" src="images/exercise/3.jpg"></div>
         <p class="no-padding"><strong>4. Garland or Squat Pose (Malasana)</strong>Hanging out in a squat like this really opens the hips and pelvis, which is ideal for prenatal practice. It is also known to stimulate digestion and is a great stretch through the legs and back. Modify for pregnancy by leaning against a wall or squatting on blankets. Only suitable until about 30 weeks.</p>
         <div class="col s12"><img class="responsive-img" src="images/exercise/4.jpg"></div>
          <p class="no-padding"><strong>5. Goddess Pose (Utkata Konasana)</strong>This is an amazing prep pose for childbirth. It opens the hips and groin and creates space in the pelvis. It also strengthens and tones the many muscles in the legs. We often have a tendency to internally collapse the knee, so line it up with your second toe to prevent injury.</p>
          <div class="col s12"><img class="responsive-img" src="images/exercise/5.jpg"></div>
          <p class="no-padding"><strong>6. Extended Triangle Pose (Trikonasana)</strong>I found Trikonasana incredibly helpful for relieving backache and creating length through the side body. It is also known for its ability to reduce stiffness in the neck, tone the pelvic floor, and relieve indigestion. Take a shorter stance than usual and microbend the front knee.</p>
          <div class="col s12"><img class="responsive-img" src="images/exercise/6.jpg"></div>
          <p class="no-padding"><strong>7. Extended Side Angle Pose (Utthita Parsvakonasana)</strong>Another lovely side body stretch to create space for the baby, Extended Side Angle is also a wonderful prep pose for childbirth as it strengthens the quads and increases stamina.</p>
          <div class="col s12"><img class="responsive-img" src="images/exercise/7.jpg"></div>
          <p class="no-padding">Modify your typical expression by resting your front elbow on your front knee rather than reaching for the floor. This will help stabilize your body as bub grows and throws off your center of gravity.</p>

         <p class="no-padding"><strong>8. Corpse Pose (Savasana)</strong>When you melt into Savasana, do so on your side, with a bolster placed between your legs as lying flat on your back is not recommended.Video Link for various yoga poses: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B87FpWtkIKA</p>
